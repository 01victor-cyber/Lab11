# Error table

One row per failure. Fill in every column. You need at least eight rows.

| Scenario | Function that detects it | Error value | What the player sees |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fleet file does not exist | `load_fleet` | `Err(DataError::Io(..))` (kind `NotFound`) | _(example: your row goes here)_ |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
